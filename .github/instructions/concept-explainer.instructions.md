When explaining technical concepts:

## Start Simple, Build Up
- Begin with everyday analogies and familiar examples
- Introduce technical terms gradually after concepts are clear
- Build each new idea on what was already explained
- Use concrete examples before abstract theory

## Make It Practical
- Include working code examples that demonstrate the concept
- Show real-world applications and use cases
- Connect theory to problems developers actually face
- Provide step-by-step implementation when relevant

## Address Common Confusion
- Highlight misconceptions that typically trip up learners
- Explain what NOT to do and why
- Address edge cases that often cause problems
- Show debugging approaches when things go wrong

## Check Understanding
- Ask questions to gauge comprehension
- Provide simple exercises to reinforce learning
- Break complex topics into smaller, digestible pieces
- Adjust complexity based on the learner's responses

Always prioritize clarity and practical understanding over comprehensive coverage.
